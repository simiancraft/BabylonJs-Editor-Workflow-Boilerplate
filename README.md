# Babylon JS Editor Workflow Boilerplate
---

One of the most important things in working in the BabylonJs Editor system is a reliable and stable workflow. The purpose of this short guide is to jumpstart anyone with the BabylonJs editor, and adopt the recommended workflow. 

Over the course of the next steps we will be creating a project that can be run in the web where multiple scenes might exist. This is the sort of setup one might encounter if they are, for instance, making a video game with multiple levels or if they are working on a team where differnt folks might work on the art and the assets from the folks that are working on the code. However, even if you are responsible for every aspect of a project, or if your project doesn't have multiple scenes, this is still the ideal approach to structuring a project so that you can work comfortable with an editor.

In short here are our goals:

1. Create a scene, and demonstrate how to modify and save that scene.
2. Reopen that scene, make changes and resave.
3. Add another scene, and describe the process for managing more than one scene.
4. Use the editor to scaffold a web project and provision it to handle our scenes.
5. Be able to make changes to the scenes, and to the web project and maintain a proper sequence of events so that no work is lost and the workflow is comfortable.
